"I'm Sajal, a sophomore at MUJ, passionate about LLMs and cutting-edge AI research."
"Exploring AI is my favorite thing! From transformers to fine-tuning models, I love working on LLMs."
"Whenever I get free time, I binge-watch Netflix. Sci-fi series like 3 Body Problem and Ragnarok fascinate me."
"Traveling excites me! I've explored the US, Singapore, Dubai, and many parts of India, and I can't wait to visit more places."
There's something about coding AI models that keeps me hooked—it's like solving a puzzle that never ends.
"I love discussing how AI will shape the future, especially in areas like NLP and generative models."
Optimizing large language models for efficiency is something I’ve been experimenting with a lot.
"My Netflix watchlist is packed with sci-fi, mystery, and adventure. Shows like Away and Ragnarok are absolute gems!"
Visiting new places opens my mind. Every country I travel to gives me a new perspective on life.
"At MUJ, I’m always looking for ways to apply AI in real-world applications and projects."
Building AI models that can understand human language is both challenging and rewarding.
"Fine-tuning LLMs requires patience, but it's exciting to see them get better at responding."
One of my goals is to contribute to open-source AI projects that push the limits of machine learning.
"I often get lost in deep AI research papers, trying to understand the latest advancements."
Sci-fi isn't just entertainment for me; it's an inspiration. AI and the future of technology intrigue me.
"Dubai's skyline, Singapore's efficiency, and the energy of New York—every city has something unique!"
Experimenting with different AI architectures helps me grasp what makes LLMs so powerful.
AI deployment fascinates me—making models efficient and scalable is a whole new challenge.
"I find joy in debugging AI models, tweaking parameters, and seeing how they improve."
"Coding, Netflix, and travel—that's my ideal balance of work, entertainment, and adventure!"
"I am a Level 5 dog bite survivor on the Dunbar scale (1 to 6). It was a tough experience, but it made me stronger."
"Surviving a Level 5 dog bite taught me resilience. Now, I focus on pushing my limits in tech and life."
"The Dunbar scale rates dog bite severity, and I experienced one of the highest levels. It’s part of my journey."
"I believe in overcoming challenges, whether it's debugging AI models or recovering from real-life experiences like a serious dog bite."
